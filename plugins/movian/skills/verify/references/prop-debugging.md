# Prop and ECMAScript Diagnostics

Read this reference when inspecting `/api/prop`, subscriber source anchors,
`prop.print`, page dumps, or ECMAScript memory/resources.

## Surface Safety

| Surface | Effect |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/ecmascript/stats` | Read-only context/resource snapshot |
| `GET /api/ecmascript/gc` | Runs GC in every ECMAScript context |
| `GET /api/prop/<path>` | Reads a prop, but a mistyped named path can materialize void props |
| `POST /api/prop/<path> action=...` | Sends an external event |
| `POST /api/prop/<path> debug=on/off` | Mutates `PROP_DEBUG_THIS`; the audited branch has no log consumer |
| `prop.print(prop)` | Recursively writes prop contents to stderr |

Do not call `gc`, POST actions, or debug toggles while claiming a read-only
audit. Treat `prop.print` output and stats paths as local/private artifacts
until sanitized.

## /api/prop Source Flow

Registration:

```text
src/prop/prop_http.c:274
http_path_add("/api/prop", NULL, hc_prop, 0)
```

GET resolution:

```text
hc_prop()
  -> prop_from_path()
  -> strvec_split(path, "/")
  -> prop_get_by_name(..., follow_symlinks=1)
  -> prop_subfind(..., allow_indexing=1)
  -> emit_value() or directory listing
  -> subscriber source lists
```

Anchors verified in this checkout (`src/prop/prop_http.c`, 280 lines total):

- `:28` `prop_from_path()` — slash-path conversion (`strvec_split` + `prop_get_by_name`).
- `:48` `emit_value()` — value serialization by `hp_type`.
- `:94` `hc_prop()` — HTTP handler entry point.
- `:121` `HTTP_CMD_POST` branch — `action=`/`debug=` handling.
- `:146` `HTTP_CMD_GET` branch.
- `:164` directory-listing loop — unnamed children get the `*N` alias.
- `:214` `#ifdef PROP_SUB_RECORD_SOURCE` — Value/Canonical Subscribers dump.
- `src/prop/prop_core.c:2682` `prop_subfind()` — symlink/path/index traversal.
- `src/prop/prop_core.c:2792` `prop_get_by_name0()` / `:2796` `prop_get_by_name()` — root resolution.
- `src/prop/prop_core.c:2912` `prop_subscribe_ex()` — subscription construction.

Always re-check lines in the target checkout before publishing them —
`prop_http.c` above matched the previously-recorded anchors exactly at every
line cited (re-verified for this issue).

### Named paths can mutate the tree

`prop_from_path()` enables indexing and follows symlinks. In
`prop_subfind()`, an absent named child can be created through `prop_create0`.
Therefore a typo such as `global/navigators/curent/...` is not guaranteed to
be a harmless 404.

Safe inspection order:

1. Read the known parent.
2. Copy the child name from the response.
3. Descend one segment at a time.
4. Use `*N` only after enumerating the current parent because indices move
   when children are added, removed, or reordered.

### Output types

| Text | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `is a 0` / `is a 1` | Integer or boolean |
| `is a 3.140000` | Float |
| `is a value` | String |
| `title uri` | URI value |
| `(void)` | Prop exists without a value |
| `(zombie)` | Deleted/stale prop |
| `(proxy)` | Proxy prop |
| `directory` | Prop has children |

Plain-text directory output lists child names. With `Accept: text/html`, the
handler emits links and inline values.

### POST modes

```bash
curl -X POST -d 'action=Activate' \
  "$BASE/api/prop/global/navigators/current/currentpage/model/nodes/*0/eventSink"

curl -X POST -d 'debug=on' \
  "$BASE/api/prop/global/navigators/current/currentpage/model/loading"

curl -X POST -d 'debug=off' \
  "$BASE/api/prop/global/navigators/current/currentpage/model/loading"
```

An action response proves only that the event was accepted. Re-read the
target props to prove the effect. Any `debug` value other than `on` clears
`PROP_DEBUG_THIS` (`src/prop/prop_http.c:132-142`).

Source search in this tree finds `PROP_DEBUG_THIS` only in the HTTP toggle
(`prop_http.c:135,137`) and its definition — there is no reader that emits a
change log when it is set. Runtime mutation after `debug=on` produces no
prop-change log. Use STPP `watch`, subscriber anchors, or the narrow dump
helpers below for actual diagnostics; do not treat `OK` as proof that prop
logging is active.

## prop.print and dump wrappers

The ECMAScript binding is registered in `src/ecmascript/es_prop.c`:

```text
prop.print -> es_prop_print_duk (es_prop.c:117) -> prop_print_tree(prop, 1) (es_prop.c:120)
```

Implementation anchors:

- `src/ecmascript/es_prop.c:117` — Duktape binding (`es_prop_print_duk`).
- `src/ecmascript/es_prop.c:1089` — `{ "print", es_prop_print_duk, 1 }` registration.
- `src/prop/prop_core.c:5895-5896` — `prop_print_tree0()`, the recursive printer.
- `src/prop/prop_core.c:6000-6001` — `prop_print_tree()`, the locked entrypoint.

The output goes to stderr and includes name and pointer, refcount/xref,
multi-subscription flags, symlink/target information, and recursive child
values and types.

Flag `1` follows links. Subscriber details require internal flags `2` and
`4`, which the JS binding does not expose. Use `/api/prop` for subscriber
anchors.

Convenience wrappers already exist:

- `Item.dump()` in `res/ecmascript/modules/movian/page.js`.
- `Page.dump()` in the same module.
- settings group `dump()` in `res/ecmascript/modules/movian/settings.js`.

Dump only the narrow page/item/settings subtree under investigation. Never
dump `prop.global` casually: output can be very large and may contain
credentials, tokens, URLs, or user data.

## ECMAScript stats and GC

Registration in `src/ecmascript/es_stats.c`:

```text
/api/ecmascript/stats -> dumpstats()   (es_stats.c:94, registered es_stats.c:153)
/api/ecmascript/gc    -> dogc()        (es_stats.c:121, registered es_stats.c:154)
```

Stats reports per context: load path; current and peak memory; rooted
ECMAScript objects; active native instances by class; permanent resources
such as routes, hooks, subscriptions, inspectors, and services.

GC obtains every context, locks it, calls `duk_gc()`, and returns `OK`.

### Leak-check recipe

1. Capture stats.
2. Exercise the target route/action N times.
3. Capture stats again.
4. Invoke GC only when authorized.
5. Capture post-GC stats.
6. Repeat multiple cycles.
7. Compare current memory, rooted object count, native instance counts, and
   permanent resource count.

Do not use peak memory as a leak assertion; peak is not expected to decrease.
One small post-GC memory change is not conclusive.

### Structured snapshot

The scripts ported from the Codex skill now live in
`support/devtools/mdevlib/` and run as modules from `support/devtools/`
(they are not yet wired into a dedicated `mdev` subcommand):

```bash
cd support/devtools

# broad agent-oriented inspection (HTTP surface + STPP)
python3 -m mdevlib.movian_agent snapshot \
  --base-url "http://127.0.0.1:$port" \
  --http-surface --stpp \
  --output /tmp/movian-agent/snapshot.json

# lightweight prop/ECMAScript-only snapshot
python3 -m mdevlib.movian_diag_snapshot \
  --base-url "http://127.0.0.1:$port" \
  --output /tmp/movian-diag.json

python3 -m mdevlib.movian_diag_snapshot \
  --base-url "http://127.0.0.1:$port" \
  --gc \
  --output /tmp/movian-diag-after-gc.json
```

`$port` is whatever `mdev run`/`mdev props`/`mdev log` reports for your
instance (or read it from `/tmp/mdev/<name>/state.json`). These scripts
record structured page props, subscriber anchors, context counts, and
optional GC deltas without embedding full raw logs or response bodies.

<!-- Split from the core repo's movian-plugin-testing skill: the "Subscriber Source
     Anchors" section (C file:line anchors into the core) stayed there. -->
